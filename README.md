## Notes

I had trouble getting the toast message to show clearly. By default, the background is a light grey, so I had to create a custom
toast message to change the background color. Another problem I ran into was the keyboard popping up upon opening the app.
That was fixed by adding to the main xml file to stop the keyboard from popping up.
